Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. This is Earth as
seen from Saturn. That is us right there.And if you look closely, ok, see this
little protuberance? That's the Moon.This image was taken by the Cassini
spacecraft on July 19th, 2013 at 21:27Coordinated Universal Time. The thing is,
NASA gave the public advanced warningof when it would be taken, which means
that this image of Earth was the firstever taken from space that some people on
Earth were actually posing for. Our planetlooks so small, insignificant, fragile.
I recently attended the premiere of Sky1's upcoming "You, Me and the Apocalypse"
with some cool YouTubers and it got methinking. In the show, the characters find
out that they're only 34 days left beforea comet smashes into Earth that's likely
to end humanity. They all react indifferent interesting ways, but what
would I do if I found out that therewere only 34 daysof human history left? Ok, my first priority
would be to get back to America to bewith my family.But after that? I don't really have a
bucket list. Except that is exactly whatI would want to spend my last few weeks
doing. Making a list to put in a bucketthat I would then send far out into
space away from Earth's impendingvaporization. The list would contain
information about us, all Earthlings. Sothat if libraries and monuments and
YouTube videos were all destroyed, arecord would still exist somewhereof what and who we were. Like a stone
thrown into a lake, the ripples your lifecauses last long after you vanish,
the tree you planted is climbed by futuregenerations, the books you donated inform
future readers. But what if it's not justyour stone that vanishes, but the entire pond?
Perhaps it's arrogance or vanity, butgetting cosmic messages in a bottle out
there, before the end, diversifies ourarchive and gives a better chance for
future alien visitors, or whatever isleft of humanity, to find out that we
were once here,to show what we learned. Maybe even to warn
future life forms of what we did or whatwe didn't prepare for. We have already
sent some messages about humanity outthere, beyond Earth, and if Earth is
completely destroyed, those messages willbe all that's left of us. What are they?
Ok, first things first. How do you writesomething for the future? I mean,
the distant future. The message might not befound for millions of years or billions.
It might be discovered by an audiencethat's completely different, not only in
language, but in senses? What ifthey can't see or hear or feel or taste
or smell like we do, or at all.What if their bodies destroy the very material
we write the message on? What languagedo you even write it in? Well, in general, math
and physics, which are believed to be thesame everywhere in the universe,
have been what we write outer space boundmessages in.Like the Arecibo message, written by
Frank Drake, Carl Sagan and others, whichwas blasted towards the M13 star cluster
in 1974. It's composed of a semi primenumber of binary digits conveying some
info about us and it should reach thecenter-ish of the M13 cluster in about
25,000 years, at whichpoint, if something intelligent lives
there and detects it, they can respondand their response will return to us
another 25,000 years later. We won't bearound for that. But Earth has also been
broadcasting its radio and TV signalsinto space. Currently it's about 200
light-years in diameter. Compared to theMilky Way, it's about this big. Aliens within
that bubble could tune in and listen toprograms we sent out through our
airwaves, but these signals thin out as thebubble expands. Across very large
distances they may be essentiallyimpossible to tune into.Maybe a physical time capsule would be
more permanent, but it can't be buried onEarth if Earth is about to be ravaged.
A time capsule in orbit might be smart,like LAGEOS-1, a satellite put into orbit
in 1976 that allows for very preciselaser measurements of positions on Earth, 
but also contains a plaque designed by Carl Sagan, uponwhich is written the numbers 1 to 10 in the binary, and the arrangement of the Earth's continents 250 million years ago,today and their estimated arrangement
in 8.4 million years, which is how long we believethe satellite's orbit will be stable. Drag caused by the thin atmosphere up where it orbits andinfluences like solar activitywill eventually cause it to fall back down
to Earth, but its plaque will serve as atime capsule - a message from us today to
whatever happens to be alive orintelligent here on Earth8 million years in the future.
To put that in perspective, the pyramidswere only built about 5,000 years ago.
8 million years ago, there weren't evenhumans on the Earth. The latest common ancestor of
humans and chimpanzees was around though.8 million years from today, when LAGEOS
returns, what will intelligent life onEarth look like? If Earth's surface is
barren of life at that point, LAGEOS-1will be alone. But what about
satellites in geostationary orbits? Theseorbits are far enough out that they're
much safer from atmospheric drag andcould remain above Earth much much
longer than satellites like LAGEOS.These satellites are our pyramids. They're
smaller than monuments built by pastcivilizations, but impervious to anything
that might go wrong on the less stablesurface of our planet. If alien
archaeologists come by in a billionyears or so, these satellites may be what
their alien encyclopedias use as thepicture for the humans article. So far we
have erected about 450of these geostationary monuments.
When such a satellite wears down andceases to be operational, it takes a lot
of energy to slow it down so it can moveout of the way and fall to Earth to burn up in
the atmosphere. So instead, they'reusually pushed into what's known as a
graveyard orbit.A shell around the planet where they can
be part without interfering withimportant operational satellites.
It's fitting that we call these graveyardorbits because tombs are often the most
stunning things we have from previouscivilizations. These graveyard orbits are
tombs in a way. Not for kings, but formachines. Junkyards that will out-exist the
very societies and people they solargely define. Luckily, a few contain
more than just our craftsmanship. Theyalso contain a record, like EchoStar XVI,
a communications satellite launched intogeostationary orbit in 2012. Aboard it is a
silicon disc created by artist TrevorPaglen, containing 100 images of
Earth and Earthlings. Now, unlike LAGEOS,EchoStar XVI will likely remain in orbit
for billions of years,safe from discord and change down here.
But here's the thing. What if our entiresolar system is lost? Or what if life out
there doesn't decide to ever visit oursystem? Well, in that case, we have sent
interstellar messages. At this moment, sofar, there are 11 distinct human made
things on trajectories out of thesolar system into interstellar space.
They're all related to five probes.Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 and
Voyager 2 and New Horizons, the thingthat recently made a Pluto flyby.
These objects are our most distant hellos.Over the next ten thousand, million,
billion years, they'll pass close enoughto other star systems, maybe even planets,
to possibly be discovered by otherintelligent life forms. We had the
foresight to include special messages onthese probes. The Pioneer plaques are
attached to Pioneer 10 and 11, whichlaunched in the early 1970's,
were the first human-made objects toever be sent on a trajectory to not just
leave Earth, but to leave the solarsystem entirely. If discovered by other
life out there, these plaques, designed byFrank Drake and Carl Sagan,
could be our first chance to say "hello,we exist," or, depending on how long
humanity lasts, our only chance to say"Hello,we existed. This is what we were." But will
the plaques makes sense to aliens? Manyhumans scientists have had trouble
deciphering their meaning, but here'swhat they say. At the bottom is a map of
our solar system with a path showing thePioneer probe itself and where it came
from. This element has been particularlycriticized for being human centric.
I mean, an arrow? Who's to say aliens will knowthat this depicts a path and not some
structure in our solar system? Also, it'san arrow. Arrows might convey this way
only two civilizations that hunted ordeveloped pointy projectiles. Anyway. 
Up here, we define units. You can't tellaliens about humans or Earth by using
seconds, kilometres or light years,because we made those measurements up.
Instead, the plaque uses hyperfinetransitions to communicate distances and time.
The hope is that curiousintelligent life forms who find this
will understand that this is a hydrogenatom - one proton, one electron. Hydrogen is
the most abundant element in theuniverse, so hopefully its properties
will be a common point of understanding.Now sometimes, if you've got enough
hydrogen around, you can catch atoms inthe heap transitioning between particles
with parallel spins and antiparallelspins. Now, whenever this transition
happens, electromagnetic radiation isreleased with a period of about 2.7
nanoseconds and a wavelength of about21 centimetres. It's hoped that
aliens equate this tick mark with thesetwo units of measurement. For example,
the woman is said to be, in binary, eight ofthese units tall. 21 centimetres times
eight is a 168 centimetres.You would think that putting
the probe itself behind them for scalewould be enough to show our size,
but having both might help solidify theconnection. This diagram is meant to show
where we live. We are in the middle.The direction and proportional length of
the lines show where distant pulsars are.A tick-mark near the ends of each line
shows the third direction, behind or infront of the plaque, that the line should
go in. In binary, next to each line is theperiod of each pulsar. Again, in the
time units described above. If aliensmake this connection they could possibly
match the periods with the correctpulsars in real life,triangulate our position and come say hello.Also, since the period of a pulsar
changes over time, they could use ourobserved periods to date back how long
ago this plaque was made. So that's howthe plaque works. It kind of feels like
we're just sending out a bunch ofscience homework to space, but how else
can you find common ground withsomething that might not resemble you in
any way you could even imagine? Despiteheading out first,the Pioneer plaques are not the first
physical messages made by us to gointerstellar.That title belongs to Voyager 1.
Currently moving at 17 km/s, it isthe most far-out thing humans have ever made.Literally. In about 40,000 years,
both Voyagers will pass within less thantwo light years of other stars.
If aliens find them, or if futurehumans find them, a golden record is attached to
both that contains information abouthumanity. The record is made of gold
plated copper with an aluminum cover,containing some uranium 238. Given its
half-life, smart aliens could analyze itto determine how long ago the record was
made. On the record is the inscription tothe makers of music All Worlds All Times.
The record contains 116 images, as wellas audio and video recordings of humans,
animals, songs and greetings in fiftyfive languages. Printed on the record are
instructions for playback and info aboutus. The hydrogen hyperfine transition
unit definition and the Pulsar map,included on the Pioneer plaques, but the
record also comes with a stylus andplatter to play it. Instructions for using
the stylus are on the record. This is apicture of the stylus being used
correctly and then in binary using thetransition units, the record tells the
aliens that the stylus should go aroundthe record once every 3.6 seconds
to play back correctly and intotal should take about one hour to do so.
For the video portion, instructionsare given in a circle. The first video
image is displayed, so they know they didit right.Also included on the record is a message
from then-president of the United States,Jimmy Carter. There's something
vulnerable about the message. It'sdelivered to an unknown recipient,
like when someone in a horror movie asksinto the darkness "Is anyone there?Hello?" This is what it says. "We cast this message
into the cosmos. It is likely to survivea billion years into the future, when our
civilization is profoundly altered andthe surface of the Earthmay be vastly changed. Of the two hundred
billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy,some, perhaps many, may have inhabited
planets and space faring civilizations.If one such civilization intercepts
Voyager and can understand theserecorded contents, here is our message.
This is a present from a small, distantworld. A token of our sounds, our science,
our images, our music, our thoughts andour feelings. We are attempting to
survive our time, so we may live intoyours. We hope someday, having solved the
problems we face, to join a community ofgalactic civilizations. This record
represents our hope and ourdetermination and our goodwill in a vast
and awesome universe." Are these messagesenough?Should we send more? Well, why not send
everything? We could, if we sent theLibrary of Babel.It's a website built by Jonathan Basile
that currently offers everything thathas been or could be written.Seriously. Divided into pages, it is built
to produce and locate on demand any 3200character combination of English letters
and the comma, space and period. Basilehas organized it all into hexagon-shaped
rooms, each with four walls of bookscontaining five shelves with 32 volumes
of four hundred and ten pages each.Everything's arranged in a pseudo-random
fashion, so browsing the online libraryfeels like a treasure hunt.
Here's how it works.Each page is given a unique sequential
page number in base 10. The text on eachpage is encased inside this number.An algorithm Basile created uses the
page number as a seed to generate aunique big number. That output is then
converted into base 29 so that it can berepresented using every letter in the
English alphabet as well as the comma,the space and the period. This is what
you see on the page. Basile has madesure that the algorithm will produce
every possible combination and the samepage number will create the same output
every time.Which means that what is on each page is
already predetermined. So, in a way, everypage already exists.
It only needs to be looked up.And here is the really mind blowing
thing. The contents of a page can beconverted to base 10, sent through the
inverted algorithm and turned into theexact page number they're found on. It's a
truly eerie experience, because you canfind the permanent location for any 3200
character text. You can find in thislibrary the description of your birth,
every possible description of your death,every poem, every joke, every lie,
anything that could be saidcan be found on this site.This thing blurs the line between invention
and discovery. Did you really discover or inventthat thing if its description already existed?
10 to the 5,000 differentpagesare offered by the Library of Babel.
In comparison, there are only 10 to the 80 atomsin the observable universe.
I searched for what I've just said andsure enough in this hexagon, on this wall,
this shelf and this volume on this page it'sthere.Hello.But deep down, we feel like there's a
difference between this programpermuting something unknowingly and
a person actually meaning it, intending it,saying it because they wanted to with
agency. We use a finite number of symbolsto say things. For that reason, a library of
every finite combination of thosesymbols can be made,
but just because it can be madedoesn't need it has been said. That is
the power we have. Perhaps you and I wereborn too late to explore the world and
too early in history to explore thestars, but we were born at just the right
time, which is pretty much all times everto explore language. To explore what can be
said. What should be said.What should we send out to space. What that
can't be said will you be the first to say?And as always,thanks for watching.To watch the trailer of You, Me and the Apocalypse
