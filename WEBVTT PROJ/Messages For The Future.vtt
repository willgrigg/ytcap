00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:13.600
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. This is Earth as
seen from Saturn. That is us right there.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.320
And if you look closely, ok, see this
little protuberance? That's the Moon.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.470
This image was taken by the Cassini
spacecraft on July 19th, 2013 at 21:27

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.279
Coordinated Universal Time. The thing is,
NASA gave the public advanced warning

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.739
of when it would be taken, which means
that this image of Earth was the first

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.989
ever taken from space that some people on
Earth were actually posing for. Our planet

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.859
looks so small, insignificant, fragile.
I recently attended the premiere of Sky

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.010
1's upcoming "You, Me and the Apocalypse"
with some cool YouTubers and it got me

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.900
thinking. In the show, the characters find
out that they're only 34 days left before

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.170
a comet smashes into Earth that's likely
to end humanity. They all react in

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.810
different interesting ways, but what
would I do if I found out that there

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.880
were only 34 days

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.780
of human history left? Ok, my first priority
would be to get back to America to be

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.280
with my family.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.430
But after that? I don't really have a
bucket list. Except that is exactly what

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.880
I would want to spend my last few weeks
doing. Making a list to put in a bucket

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.130
that I would then send far out into
space away from Earth's impending

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:54.270
vaporization. The list would contain
information about us, all Earthlings. So

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.369
that if libraries and monuments and
YouTube videos were all destroyed, a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.869
record would still exist somewhere

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.899
of what and who we were. Like a stone
thrown into a lake, the ripples your life

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.200
causes last long after you vanish,
the tree you planted is climbed by future

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.300
generations, the books you donated inform
future readers. But what if it's not just

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:31.300
your stone that vanishes, but the entire pond?
Perhaps it's arrogance or vanity, but

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.590
getting cosmic messages in a bottle out
there, before the end, diversifies our

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.530
archive and gives a better chance for
future alien visitors, or whatever is

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.200
left of humanity, to find out that we
were once here,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.110
to show what we learned. Maybe even to warn
future life forms of what we did or what

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.170
we didn't prepare for. We have already
sent some messages about humanity out

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.440
there, beyond Earth, and if Earth is
completely destroyed, those messages will

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.630
be all that's left of us. What are they?
Ok, first things first. How do you write

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.230
something for the future? I mean,
the distant future. The message might not be

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.470
found for millions of years or billions.
It might be discovered by an audience

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.319
that's completely different, not only in
language, but in senses? What if

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.979
they can't see or hear or feel or taste
or smell like we do, or at all.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.060
What if their bodies destroy the very material
we write the message on? What language

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.700
do you even write it in? Well, in general, math
and physics, which are believed to be the

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.250
same everywhere in the universe,
have been what we write outer space bound

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.250
messages in.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.150
Like the Arecibo message, written by
Frank Drake, Carl Sagan and others, which

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.270
was blasted towards the M13 star cluster
in 1974. It's composed of a semi prime

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.060
number of binary digits conveying some
info about us and it should reach the

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.530
center-ish of the M13 cluster in about
25,000 years, at which

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.850
point, if something intelligent lives
there and detects it, they can respond

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.600
and their response will return to us
another 25,000 years later. We won't be

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.660
around for that. But Earth has also been
broadcasting its radio and TV signals

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.500
into space. Currently it's about 200
light-years in diameter. Compared to the

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.440
Milky Way, it's about this big. Aliens within
that bubble could tune in and listen to

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.630
programs we sent out through our
airwaves, but these signals thin out as the

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.240
bubble expands. Across very large
distances they may be essentially

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.550
impossible to tune into.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.300
Maybe a physical time capsule would be
more permanent, but it can't be buried on

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.610
Earth if Earth is about to be ravaged.
A time capsule in orbit might be smart,

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:22.630
like LAGEOS-1, a satellite put into orbit
in 1976 that allows for very precise

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:30.400
laser measurements of positions on Earth, 
but also contains a plaque designed by Carl Sagan, upon

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:39.940
which is written the numbers 1 to 10 in the binary, and the arrangement of the Earth's continents 250 million years ago,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:47.460
today and their estimated arrangement
in 8.4 million years, which is how long we believe

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:54.100
the satellite's orbit will be stable. Drag caused by the thin atmosphere up where it orbits and

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.280
influences like solar activity

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.330
will eventually cause it to fall back down
to Earth, but its plaque will serve as a

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:07.290
time capsule - a message from us today to
whatever happens to be alive or

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.260
intelligent here on Earth

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.660
8 million years in the future.
To put that in perspective, the pyramids

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:21.890
were only built about 5,000 years ago.
8 million years ago, there weren't even

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:29.400
humans on the Earth. The latest common ancestor of
humans and chimpanzees was around though.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.840
8 million years from today, when LAGEOS
returns, what will intelligent life on

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.960
Earth look like? If Earth's surface is
barren of life at that point, LAGEOS-1

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.760
will be alone. But what about
satellites in geostationary orbits? These

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.170
orbits are far enough out that they're
much safer from atmospheric drag and

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:56.370
could remain above Earth much much
longer than satellites like LAGEOS.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:02.300
These satellites are our pyramids. They're
smaller than monuments built by past

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.540
civilizations, but impervious to anything
that might go wrong on the less stable

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:12.090
surface of our planet. If alien
archaeologists come by in a billion

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:18.520
years or so, these satellites may be what
their alien encyclopedias use as the

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:25.080
picture for the humans article. So far we
have erected about 450

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.220
of these geostationary monuments.
When such a satellite wears down and

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.590
ceases to be operational, it takes a lot
of energy to slow it down so it can move

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.000
out of the way and fall to Earth to burn up in
the atmosphere. So instead, they're

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.260
usually pushed into what's known as a
graveyard orbit.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.600
A shell around the planet where they can
be part without interfering with

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.090
important operational satellites.
It's fitting that we call these graveyard

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:59.710
orbits because tombs are often the most
stunning things we have from previous

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:07.280
civilizations. These graveyard orbits are
tombs in a way. Not for kings, but for

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.620
machines. Junkyards that will out-exist the
very societies and people they so

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:19.330
largely define. Luckily, a few contain
more than just our craftsmanship. They

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:26.280
also contain a record, like EchoStar XVI,
a communications satellite launched into

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:32.630
geostationary orbit in 2012. Aboard it is a
silicon disc created by artist Trevor

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:38.990
Paglen, containing 100 images of
Earth and Earthlings. Now, unlike LAGEOS,

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:46.270
EchoStar XVI will likely remain in orbit
for billions of years,

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:53.580
safe from discord and change down here.
But here's the thing. What if our entire

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:59.390
solar system is lost? Or what if life out
there doesn't decide to ever visit our

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:05.870
system? Well, in that case, we have sent
interstellar messages. At this moment, so

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:11.680
far, there are 11 distinct human made
things on trajectories out of the

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.870
solar system into interstellar space.
They're all related to five probes.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:23.720
Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 and
Voyager 2 and New Horizons, the thing

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:30.990
that recently made a Pluto flyby.
These objects are our most distant hellos.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:36.370
Over the next ten thousand, million,
billion years, they'll pass close enough

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:41.070
to other star systems, maybe even planets,
to possibly be discovered by other

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:46.649
intelligent life forms. We had the
foresight to include special messages on

00:09:46.649 --> 00:09:52.990
these probes. The Pioneer plaques are
attached to Pioneer 10 and 11, which

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.839
launched in the early 1970's,
were the first human-made objects to

00:09:57.839 --> 00:10:02.680
ever be sent on a trajectory to not just
leave Earth, but to leave the solar

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:10.060
system entirely. If discovered by other
life out there, these plaques, designed by

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:15.459
Frank Drake and Carl Sagan,
could be our first chance to say "hello,

00:10:15.459 --> 00:10:22.310
we exist," or, depending on how long
humanity lasts, our only chance to say

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.540
"Hello,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:31.320
we existed. This is what we were." But will
the plaques makes sense to aliens? Many

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.279
humans scientists have had trouble
deciphering their meaning, but here's

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:40.730
what they say. At the bottom is a map of
our solar system with a path showing the

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:45.690
Pioneer probe itself and where it came
from. This element has been particularly

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:51.709
criticized for being human centric.
I mean, an arrow? Who's to say aliens will know

00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:58.070
that this depicts a path and not some
structure in our solar system? Also, it's

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:03.640
an arrow. Arrows might convey this way
only two civilizations that hunted or

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:10.290
developed pointy projectiles. Anyway. 
Up here, we define units. You can't tell

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.540
aliens about humans or Earth by using
seconds, kilometres or light years,

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:20.380
because we made those measurements up.
Instead, the plaque uses hyperfine

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:26.230
transitions to communicate distances and time.
The hope is that curious

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:32.110
intelligent life forms who find this
will understand that this is a hydrogen

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:38.440
atom - one proton, one electron. Hydrogen is
the most abundant element in the

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.880
universe, so hopefully its properties
will be a common point of understanding.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.720
Now sometimes, if you've got enough
hydrogen around, you can catch atoms in

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:53.450
the heap transitioning between particles
with parallel spins and antiparallel

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:58.300
spins. Now, whenever this transition
happens, electromagnetic radiation is

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:04.370
released with a period of about 2.7
nanoseconds and a wavelength of about

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:09.780
21 centimetres. It's hoped that
aliens equate this tick mark with these

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:16.130
two units of measurement. For example,
the woman is said to be, in binary, eight of

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:21.680
these units tall. 21 centimetres times
eight is a 168 centimetres.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.520
You would think that putting
the probe itself behind them for scale

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.330
would be enough to show our size,
but having both might help solidify the

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:36.430
connection. This diagram is meant to show
where we live. We are in the middle.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:41.790
The direction and proportional length of
the lines show where distant pulsars are.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.940
A tick-mark near the ends of each line
shows the third direction, behind or in

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:52.140
front of the plaque, that the line should
go in. In binary, next to each line is the

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:58.100
period of each pulsar. Again, in the
time units described above. If aliens

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.590
make this connection they could possibly
match the periods with the correct

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.570
pulsars in real life,

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:09.500
triangulate our position and come say hello.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:15.090
Also, since the period of a pulsar
changes over time, they could use our

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:20.930
observed periods to date back how long
ago this plaque was made. So that's how

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:26.020
the plaque works. It kind of feels like
we're just sending out a bunch of

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:30.390
science homework to space, but how else
can you find common ground with

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:35.500
something that might not resemble you in
any way you could even imagine? Despite

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.850
heading out first,

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.540
the Pioneer plaques are not the first
physical messages made by us to go

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.769
interstellar.

00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:49.459
That title belongs to Voyager 1.
Currently moving at 17 km/s, it is

00:13:49.459 --> 00:13:53.379
the most far-out thing humans have ever made.

00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:58.720
Literally. In about 40,000 years,
both Voyagers will pass within less than

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:04.509
two light years of other stars.
If aliens find them, or if future

00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:10.699
humans find them, a golden record is attached to
both that contains information about

00:14:10.699 --> 00:14:15.749
humanity. The record is made of gold
plated copper with an aluminum cover,

00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:21.939
containing some uranium 238. Given its
half-life, smart aliens could analyze it

00:14:21.939 --> 00:14:27.610
to determine how long ago the record was
made. On the record is the inscription to

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:36.220
the makers of music All Worlds All Times.
The record contains 116 images, as well

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:41.339
as audio and video recordings of humans,
animals, songs and greetings in fifty

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:47.850
five languages. Printed on the record are
instructions for playback and info about

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:52.850
us. The hydrogen hyperfine transition
unit definition and the Pulsar map,

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.559
included on the Pioneer plaques, but the
record also comes with a stylus and

00:14:57.559 --> 00:15:03.720
platter to play it. Instructions for using
the stylus are on the record. This is a

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.369
picture of the stylus being used
correctly and then in binary using the

00:15:08.369 --> 00:15:12.509
transition units, the record tells the
aliens that the stylus should go around

00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:17.519
the record once every 3.6 seconds
to play back correctly and in

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:22.889
total should take about one hour to do so.
For the video portion, instructions

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:28.009
are given in a circle. The first video
image is displayed, so they know they did

00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:28.910
it right.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:33.540
Also included on the record is a message
from then-president of the United States,

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:38.199
Jimmy Carter. There's something
vulnerable about the message. It's

00:15:38.199 --> 00:15:43.180
delivered to an unknown recipient,
like when someone in a horror movie asks

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.640
into the darkness "Is anyone there?

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:58.250
Hello?" This is what it says. "We cast this message
into the cosmos. It is likely to survive

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:03.950
a billion years into the future, when our
civilization is profoundly altered and

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.230
the surface of the Earth

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:10.480
may be vastly changed. Of the two hundred
billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:16.840
some, perhaps many, may have inhabited
planets and space faring civilizations.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:21.840
If one such civilization intercepts
Voyager and can understand these

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:29.670
recorded contents, here is our message.
This is a present from a small, distant

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:36.700
world. A token of our sounds, our science,
our images, our music, our thoughts and

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:42.060
our feelings. We are attempting to
survive our time, so we may live into

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:48.590
yours. We hope someday, having solved the
problems we face, to join a community of

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:53.970
galactic civilizations. This record
represents our hope and our

00:16:53.970 --> 00:17:01.390
determination and our goodwill in a vast
and awesome universe." Are these messages

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.030
enough?

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:11.210
Should we send more? Well, why not send
everything? We could, if we sent the

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.740
Library of Babel.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:19.910
It's a website built by Jonathan Basile
that currently offers everything that

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:24.100
has been or could be written.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:32.059
Seriously. Divided into pages, it is built
to produce and locate on demand any 3200

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:37.030
character combination of English letters
and the comma, space and period. Basile

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:42.120
has organized it all into hexagon-shaped
rooms, each with four walls of books

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.280
containing five shelves with 32 volumes
of four hundred and ten pages each.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:52.600
Everything's arranged in a pseudo-random
fashion, so browsing the online library

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:58.000
feels like a treasure hunt.
Here's how it works.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.870
Each page is given a unique sequential
page number in base 10. The text on each

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:09.000
page is encased inside this number.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.760
An algorithm Basile created uses the
page number as a seed to generate a

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:19.270
unique big number. That output is then
converted into base 29 so that it can be

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.760
represented using every letter in the
English alphabet as well as the comma,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.000
the space and the period. This is what
you see on the page. Basile has made

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.820
sure that the algorithm will produce
every possible combination and the same

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:39.010
page number will create the same output
every time.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:47.900
Which means that what is on each page is
already predetermined. So, in a way, every

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:53.420
page already exists.
It only needs to be looked up.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:58.850
And here is the really mind blowing
thing. The contents of a page can be

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:04.100
converted to base 10, sent through the
inverted algorithm and turned into the

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:12.810
exact page number they're found on. It's a
truly eerie experience, because you can

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:19.660
find the permanent location for any 3200
character text. You can find in this

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:25.930
library the description of your birth,
every possible description of your death,

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:31.160
every poem, every joke, every lie,
anything that could be said

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.310
can be found on this site.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:44.060
This thing blurs the line between invention
and discovery. Did you really discover or invent

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.630
that thing if its description already existed?
10 to the 5,000 different

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:50.440
pages

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:57.800
are offered by the Library of Babel.
In comparison, there are only 10 to the 80 atoms

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:03.560
in the observable universe.
I searched for what I've just said and

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:10.250
sure enough in this hexagon, on this wall,
this shelf and this volume on this page it's

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.020
there.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:12.999
Hello.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.869
But deep down, we feel like there's a
difference between this program

00:20:18.869 --> 00:20:24.269
permuting something unknowingly and
a person actually meaning it, intending it,

00:20:24.269 --> 00:20:31.059
saying it because they wanted to with
agency. We use a finite number of symbols

00:20:31.059 --> 00:20:37.409
to say things. For that reason, a library of
every finite combination of those

00:20:37.409 --> 00:20:42.109
symbols can be made,
but just because it can be made

00:20:42.109 --> 00:20:50.149
doesn't need it has been said. That is
the power we have. Perhaps you and I were

00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:55.609
born too late to explore the world and
too early in history to explore the

00:20:55.609 --> 00:21:01.839
stars, but we were born at just the right
time, which is pretty much all times ever

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:10.600
to explore language. To explore what can be
said. What should be said.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:17.500
What should we send out to space. What that
can't be said will you be the first to say?

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.120
And as always,

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.120
thanks for watching.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:42.750
To watch the trailer of You, Me and the Apocalypse
click right up there and

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:47.140

you can also click right over there.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:54.299
Colin Furze is building a giant
apocalyptic bunker in his backyard, like

00:21:54.299 --> 00:22:00.510
for real. It's huge. Also, The Dictionary of
Obscure Sorrows has weight in. Check those

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.650
out and thanks for watching.
